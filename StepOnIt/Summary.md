Ever had a cloud bill you weren't expecting?

Managing cloud costs effectively is more than just cutting down on expenses; it's about creating smart, adaptable systems that respond to events as they happen. In this intermediate session, tailored for data professionals, cloud architects and DevOps engineers, we'll examine how event-based architectures can transform the way we monitor, manage and optimise cloud spending, with a spotlight on AWS services like Step Functions, CloudTrail, and EventBridge.

We'll explore:

- Event-Based Principles: Understanding the difference between event-based and event-driven architectures, and why it matters for cost control.

- Automating Cost Control: Discover how various cloud services can work together to create dynamic workflows that detect and respond to events and anomalies.

- Building the Solution: Step-by-step guidance on designing, deploying, and maintaining architectures that monitor and manage costs.

Additionally, I'll feature a live demonstration utilising AWS Step Functions to showcase real-time cost optimisation.

This session provides valuable insights for implementing scalable, event-based solutions in your cloud infrastructure, enabling you to improve your skills and revolutionize your approach to managing cloud costs.
